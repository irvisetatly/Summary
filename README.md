Uranus is the seventh planet discovered in the Solar System that also led to the discovery of the last planet, Neptune they are both referred to as ice giants. Officially recognized in 1781 after many observations in the past, it is the third-largest planet of the Solar System.

Though it is visible to the naked eye, Uranus escaped clear classification for decades. Generally mistaken for a star, it is speculated that Hipparchos might have recorded it first in 128 BC in his star catalogue. Later it was incorporated into Ptolemy’s Almagest.

However, the earliest definite sighting was in 1690. John Flamsteed observed it six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. Later it was observed for about fourteen-times by Charles Le Monnier between 1750 and 1769. The man who finally solved this elusive object was William Herschel who observed it on 13 March 1781 with a telescope.

Although he first classified it as a comet, soon after reporting his discovery to other famous astronomers, it was concluded that in fact it was a planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this and later was rewarded by the then king of England George III, on the condition that he moved to Windsor, in order for the royal family to also see it.

However, another problem was raised now, the name. It took about 70 years after the planet was discovered for astronomers to arrive at a consensus. Initially Herschel wanted to honor the king and name the new planet Georgium Sidus or “Georgian Planet.” This decision was not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were proposed such as Herschel’s own name, to even that of Neptune who wasn’t by this time discovered. Neptune was quite popular since it would have honored the British Royal Naval victories in the course of the American Revolutionary War, but it was soon dropped.

In 1782 Johann Bode proposed the name Uranus, the Latinized version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. His argument was that the new planet would stand out from the others if it wasn’t following the mythology.  Just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn. In 1789, an acquaintance of Bode, Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode’s choice. The name became universal in 1850.

In other languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese, Uranus is translated as “sky king star.” Its official name in Thai is Dao Yurenat, in Mongolian Tengeriin Van meaning “King of the Sky” but in Hawaiian its name is Hele’ekala, a loanword for the discoverer of Uranus, Herschel.

# Formation
Through simulations after the Nice model, it has been suggested that both Uranus and Neptune formed closer to the sun and later drifted away. It is hypothesized that the Solar System formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the pre-solar nebula. Much of it formed the Sun while more of its dust went on and merged to create the first proto-planets. As they grew, some accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold unto the nebula’s leftover gas. Estimates suggest the creation to have taken place about 4.5 billion years ago, and the drifting about 4 billion.

# Distance, Size and Mass
Since its discovery, the planet has shifted it 1° west every 72 years however, its average distance from the sun still remains about 20 AU or 2 billion kilometers – 2 billion miles. The difference between its furthest and closest point from the sun is about 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet with the exception of the dwarf planet Pluto.

Though its mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, it is the least massive compared to the other giant planets, having a mass of 8.681 × 10^25 kg. However, its diameter is slightly larger than that of Neptune, and it’s about four times that of Earth: about 51.118 kilometers or 31.763 miles.

The density of Uranus 1.27 g/cm3 makes it the second least dense planet, after Saturn. This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices such as water, ammonia, and methane. The mass of its interior is however debatable, it is speculated to be around 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses.

Orbit and Rotation 
It takes Uranus about 7 years to pass through each zodiac constellation, and a total of 84 years to make a complete trip around the sun. Its interesting orbing caught the attention of astronomers because the planet escaped its predicted location, and thus it led to the discovery of the last planet in 1846 that would later be called Neptune.

The interior rotation of Uranus is completed in about 17 hours, 14 minutes, and as in the case of all the gas giants its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation thus making a full rotation faster, in about 14 hours.

The axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System, with a tilt of 97.77°. This feature gives Uranus completely different seasonal changes unlike those of other planets.

Near the solstice, one pole faces the sun continuously while the other is covered in complete darkness. At the other side of Uranus’s orbit the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed with each pole getting around 42 years of continuous light, and the other of darkness. Neat the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus giving a period of day-night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.

Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. We do not know why this is so, nor do we know exactly why Uranus has such an unusual axial tilt. However, speculations suggest that Uranus suffered about 3 to 4 billion years ago, a collision with an Earth-sized protoplanet while the solar system was forming.

The standard model structure of Uranus consists of three layers: a rocky silicate/iron-nickel core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.
